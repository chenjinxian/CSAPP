1.Get the assembly code file by the command in terminal
objdump -d bomb > bomb64.s

Get strings of bomb
strings bomb > bomb.strings

Open binary file by hexedit
hexedit bomb 

2.Static and Dynamic Analysis bomb
2.use command "objdump -p bomb" to get Program Header
the bomb start at address 0x0000000000400000 (tips: look more by stack protector)
in hexedit, we can see tha bomb start at 0x00000000, so the real address must be add 0x00400000

Static analysis:
open bomb64.s in vi
go to the function phase_1 at address 0x400ee0
int phase_1, we can see the function call of strings_not_equal with two argments, one is the input_string by argment of phase_1, another is a point to address 0x402400
in hexedit, go to address 0x402400-0x00000000 0x0002400, we can see the address point to a string with 0 terminate.

the string is "Border relations with Canada have never been better."

to verify the string, just run the bomb and type the string command line
the phase_1 is passed, get it!

Dynamic analysis:
use gdb to debug the bomb, the command is below:
gdb bomb
(gdb) break(b) phase_1(*0x400ee0)
(gdb) run(r)
at here, we type a string whatever, like "test", then break at phase_1
(gdb) x/s $edi
(gdb) x/s $esi
show the <input_strings>:   "test"
(gdb) stepi 2
after instruct mov $0x402400,$esi, we set esi with the point to address 0x402400
(gdb) x/s $esi
we can the address 0x402400 point to a string of "Border relations with Canada have never been better.",and is not equal to the string "test", then the function strings_not_equal return 1
instruct "test %eax,%eax" set condition to 1, so "je 0x400ef7" not execute, then call function explode_bomb
the explode_bomb just puts(0x4025a3), puts(0x4025ac), and eixt(8); 0x4025a3 and 0x4025ac can be look at hexedit with address 0x0025a3, 0x0025ac, or int gdb x/s 0x4025a3(0x4025ac)

now, we use the correct string(point to 0x402400) replace of "test", phase_1 passed
